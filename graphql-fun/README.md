# graphql-fun

This is just a small app i build to try out GraphQL!

## getting started

### server

To run the GraphQL server run `yarn install` in `/server` and make sure to update the database-config in the `db.js` 
to your database. The server will automatically generate some data to query.

Start the server with `yarn start` inside the `/server` folder.

You can connect to GraphiQL UI on `localhost:4000/graphql`

### webapp

To run the React webapp run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in `/webapp`.
